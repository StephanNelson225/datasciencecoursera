cachematrix.R
## included are two function makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve.
I am clueless about these functions.  Peer assessors, thank you but I
don't need any points for this part of the programming assigment.
I will need to take this course again with a better understanding of
the amount of work entailed.

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
